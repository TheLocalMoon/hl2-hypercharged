// This is a variant of mapbase_default_manifest.txt designed for "ADDON" path IDs rather than individual maps.
// This was created so that addon creators can create files of generic names without having to create their own manifest file.
// There is no penalty for having a file missing. You could use this as a template for your own manifest file, too.
// 
// Remember: Addon paths with their own default manifest file (%mapname%_mapbase_manifest.txt) will *not* load this file.
// 
// Tokens:
// %mapname% - The name of the folder/VPK (this is called "mapname" due to overlap with the original map-specific code)
// %language% - UI language
//
